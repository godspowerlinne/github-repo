Certainly! Let me explain the selected code, which is the `showSlides` function:

```javascript
function showSlides(n) {
    let slides = document.getElementsByClassName("slide");
    if (n > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1}
    if (n < 1) {slideIndex = slides.length}
    for (let i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
        slides[i].style.display = "none";
    }
    slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block";
}
```

This function is responsible for displaying the correct slide in a slideshow. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. The function takes a parameter `n`, which represents the index of the slide to be shown.

2. `let slides = document.getElementsByClassName("slide");` retrieves all elements with the class name "slide" and stores them in the `slides` variable. This is likely an array-like object containing all the slides in the slideshow.

3. The next two lines handle wrapping around the slideshow:
   - `if (n > slides.length) {slideIndex = 1}`: If `n` is greater than the number of slides, it sets `slideIndex` to 1, effectively wrapping to the first slide.
   - `if (n < 1) {slideIndex = slides.length}`: If `n` is less than 1, it sets `slideIndex` to the last slide, wrapping to the end of the slideshow.

4. The `for` loop iterates through all slides and sets their `display` style to "none", effectively hiding all slides:
   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
       slides[i].style.display = "none";
   }
   ```

5. Finally, `slides[slideIndex-1].style.display = "block";` sets the `display` style of the slide at index `slideIndex-1` to "block", making it visible. The `-1` is used because array indices start at 0, while `slideIndex` starts at 1.

This function ensures that only one slide is visible at a time and handles the circular navigation of the slideshow, allowing it to loop back to the beginning when reaching the end and vice versa.

## setInterval
```javascript
setInterval(() => {
    plusSlides(1);  
}, 5000);
```

### Explanation:

1. **`setInterval`**:
   - `setInterval` is a JavaScript function that repeatedly calls a specified function or executes a specified code snippet at a fixed time delay.
   - The syntax is `setInterval(function, delay, [arg1, arg2, ...])`.

2. **Anonymous Arrow Function**:
   - `() => { plusSlides(1); }` is an anonymous arrow function that calls the `plusSlides` function with the argument `1`.
   - Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript.

3. **`plusSlides(1)`**:
   - `plusSlides` is a function that is assumed to be defined elsewhere in your code.
   - The argument `1` is passed to this function, which likely indicates that the function should move to the next slide in a slideshow.

4. **`5000`**:
   - The delay is set to 5000 milliseconds, which is equivalent to 5 seconds.
   - This means that the `plusSlides(1)` function will be called every 5 seconds.

### Purpose:

This code is typically used in a slideshow or carousel to automatically advance to the next slide every 5 seconds. The `plusSlides` function is responsible for changing the current slide, and the `1` argument indicates that it should move to the next slide.

### Example Usage:

If you have a slideshow with multiple images, and you want it to automatically change to the next image every 5 seconds, you would use this code. Here is a simple example of how `plusSlides` might be defined:

```javascript
let slideIndex = 1;
showSlides(slideIndex);

function plusSlides(n) {
    showSlides(slideIndex += n);
}

function showSlides(n) {
    let i;
    let slides = document.getElementsByClassName("mySlides");
    if (n > slides.length) { slideIndex = 1 }
    if (n < 1) { slideIndex = slides.length }
    for (i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) {
        slides[i].style.display = "none";
    }
    slides[slideIndex - 1].style.display = "block";
}

setInterval(() => {
    plusSlides(1);
}, 5000);
```

In this example:
- `slideIndex` keeps track of the current slide.
- `showSlides` is a function that displays the current slide and hides all others.
- `plusSlides` is a function that increments the `slideIndex` and calls `showSlides` to display the next slide.
- `setInterval` calls `plusSlides(1)` every 5 seconds to advance the slideshow.
