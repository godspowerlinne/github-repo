# Bootstrap Framework Overview
=====================================

## Introduction
---------------

Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework used for building responsive and mobile-first web applications. It was first released in 2011 and has since become one of the most widely used frameworks in the world.

## Key Features
----------------

*   **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap allows developers to create responsive web applications that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
*   **Pre-built Components**: Bootstrap comes with a wide range of pre-built components, including navigation bars, alerts, and modals.
*   **Customizable**: Bootstrap is highly customizable, allowing developers to modify the framework to suit their needs.
*   **Large Community**: Bootstrap has a large and active community, which means there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.

## Basic Structure
-------------------

A basic Bootstrap project consists of the following files:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the content of the web application.
*   `bootstrap.min.css`: The minified CSS file that contains the Bootstrap styles.
*   `bootstrap.min.js`: The minified JavaScript file that contains the Bootstrap scripts.

## Grid System
----------------

Bootstrap uses a grid system to create responsive layouts. The grid system consists of rows and columns, and is based on a 12-column grid.

*   **Container**: The container is the outermost element that contains the grid.
*   **Row**: The row is a horizontal element that contains the columns.
*   **Column**: The column is a vertical element that contains the content.

## Common Classes

*   `container`: The container class is used to create a container element.
*   `row`: The row class is used to create a row element.
*   `col-*`: The col-* classes are used to create column elements, where * is the number of columns (e.g. `col-md-4`).
*   `text-*`: The text-* classes are used to align text (e.g. `text-center`).
*   `btn`: The btn class is used to create a button element.
*   `btn-*`: The btn-* classes are used to style buttons (e.g. `btn-primary`).
