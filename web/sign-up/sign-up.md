# Sign Up Functionality

## Overview
This document provides an explanation of the sign-up functionality implemented in the web application. The sign-up form allows users to create an account by providing necessary information and validating their input.

## Form Fields
- **First Name**: A text input for the user's first name (required).
- **Last Name**: A text input for the user's last name (required).
- **Email**: An email input for the user's email address (required).
- **Phone Number**: A text input for the user's phone number (required).
- **Gender**: Radio buttons for selecting the user's gender (required).
- **Date of Birth**: A date input for the user's date of birth (required).
- **Password**: A password input for the user's password (required).
- **Confirm Password**: A password input to confirm the user's password (required).
- **Terms and Conditions**: A checkbox to agree to the terms (required).

## Validation Logic
The sign-up form includes validation for the password fields:
- **Password Match**: The password and confirm password fields must match.
- **Password Length**: The password must be between 8 and 16 characters.
- **Password Complexity**: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.

Error messages are displayed in the `errorMessage` element if any validation fails.

## JavaScript Structure
The JavaScript code is organized as follows:
- **Constants**: DOM elements are selected and stored in constants for easy access.
- **Validation Functions**: Functions are defined to handle password validation and error message management.
- **Event Listeners**: Event listeners are set up for input validation and form submission prevention if there are errors.

This structure enhances readability and maintainability of the code.
